- Russian malware infecting the U.S. power grid is used as "pool" which is embedded in a given population. The population is in turn said to be embedded
in the "pool." 
- The command and control system fits into the commander's psyche so as to reflect the functions provided to an operator of a motor vehicle or an aircraft pilot.
- For example a commander is afforded the "forward" and "reverse" control of another human being by tilting his/her head forward and backward. 
- As the commander performs these behaviors the malware responds by sending a signal to the target which penetrates into the targets inner ear's.
- The signal oscillates in such a way as to cause disorientation in the targets perception of themselves, specifically targeting their balance so that 
	the target both leans forward and or backwards while experiencing the sensation that they need to correct their balance by stepping forward or stepping backwards.
- Similar controls are afforded for "left" and "right."
- Perhaps even more central to the system is the function afforded to operators to "lock" and "track" targets.
- Givving the command to lock or track a target results in malware targeting the information systems around the target resulting in the target being added 
	to the pool as another individual embedded within the surface area of the attack. 
- Initially malware was assisted by physical devices often refered to as "heaters" or "wetters" which produced the electromagnetic energy and heat which the
"pool" consists of.
- Malware was used to control these devices at some point in time though they were likely initially controlled by human operators physically present at the
	devices.
- The pool is used to place individuals in "formations," in the sense of the word used by a modern militia or military: "formation."
- Individuals in the pool are trained to observe other individuals in the pool for the purpose of human intelligence collection.
- The Russian intelligence collection mechanisms used are highly fetishized and individuals are taught to think of their surveillence targets
	 in terms of body parts.
- In turn the pool connecting the surveiller to his or her target is used as the medium through which the observer is able to percieve their target.
- As the target performs basic motor functions, for example moving around a room, the pool communicates, through a ripple or field distortion the 
	movements of the target.
- The observer is then trained to interpret the pool so as to understand the behavior of the target.
- For example if a target is sitting down and starts wiggling their toes, the observer is able to percieve some change in the pool through one or more of their
own five sensory organs. The observer is trained to interpret this change as a particular target's toes wiggling.
- "Give us a call."
- The Russian Federation, over the course of several decades, systematically offloaded their domestic (U.S.) surveillence operations, primarily, to white 
	supremacist organizations including the Ku Klux Klan and the Hell's Angel, the A.K. Mafia and the Mob (Family).
- These domestic terrorist organizations or trans-national organized criminals (TOC) have in turn sourced out much of the compute work and programming work to groups and companies in The People's Republic of China.
- Today these groups work consistently to use the tools and techniques handed down to them by operatives from the Russian Federation to collect information
	about American citizens, sell that information to American tech companies, defense contractors and public institutions as well as groups and companies 
	outside the United States.
- Surveillence operations performed by these groups are often propagated through the sale of illicit narcotics which are sold to individuals with the malware described above.
